Abstract
The seed collecting phase of the ‘Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change’ project was, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive crop wild relatives (CWR) collecting and conservation mission to-date and provides priceless genetic diversity for ongoing and future crop breeding efforts. The seed collecting started in 2013 and was concluded in 2019, it was carried out in 22 countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, involving CWR taxa of 28 different crop genepools. 3002 target seed accessions of 242 taxa were collected and are currently stored long-term in the countries of collection and, in most of the cases, backed up at the Millennium Seed Bank (UK). Considering also non-target species, 3854 seed accessions were collected. For the genepools of bambara groundnut, barley, grass pea, sorghum, and wheat, the collecting phase was highly successful in terms of diversity of both, species and populations. Despite the overall success of the project, in our analysis we discovered several issues that were encountered in the seed collecting. In particular, comparing the initial collecting targets with the seed accessions effectively collected it emerges that: 1) some important crop genepools were characterized by a low collecting success (e.g. banana/plantain, potato, rice),  2) genepool 1 (the most important for breeding efforts) of some crop genepools was under-collected (e.g. eggplant and sorghum), 3) some important centres of  plant biodiversity (especially the Indian Subcontinent) were underrepresented in the seed collecting. This analysis can guide further collecting missions in order to fill gaps in the long-term conservation of CWR of great importance for crop improvement.
